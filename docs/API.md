# API and socket contract

Maintained alongside the code. See Development Playbook sections 10 and 11 for the full contract. Additions made during the build are recorded here.

## Added to the playbook contract

- `POST /api/auth/forgot` `{ email }`: always returns 204. Sends a reset link when an account with that email exists.
- `POST /api/auth/reset` `{ token, password }`: 204 on success; 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` when the token is invalid or expired. Revokes all refresh tokens.
